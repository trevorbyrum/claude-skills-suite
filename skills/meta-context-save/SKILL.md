# Meta Context Save

Preserve session state before compacting or clearing context. Two modes:

- **Compact mode** (default / `--compact`): Assess state → store compact state → subagent review → correct → `/compact`
- **Clear mode** (`--clear`): GitHub sync → store compact state → subagent review → correct → `/clear`

## Mode Selection

| Trigger | Mode |
|---|---|
| `/meta-context-save` | Compact |
| `/meta-context-save --compact` | Compact |
| `/meta-context-save --clear` | Clear |
| "wrap up", "done for today" | Clear |
| "save session", "compact" | Compact |
| "start fresh", "new session" | Clear |

## Instructions

### Phase 0: GitHub Sync (Clear mode only)

1. **Invoke github-sync.** Commit and push all changes in the working tree.
2. **Derive the commit message from the session.** Summarize actual work — not "session end" but "feat: add JWT refresh rotation and Redis token store".
3. **Confirm the push succeeded** and the tree is clean before proceeding. If the push fails, resolve or report before continuing — do not clear context with unpushed work.

### Phase 1: Assess Current State

Before writing anything, take stock of:
- What task is currently active (or was just completed)
- What step of that task you're on
- What has been accomplished so far
- What remains to be done
- Any pending decisions or open questions
- Files currently being worked on (with absolute paths)
- Errors being debugged, including reproduction steps
- Any important context that would be expensive to re-derive

### Phase 2: Write Compact File

Store the compact state in the artifact DB:

```bash
source artifacts/db.sh
db_upsert 'meta-context-save' 'compact' 'claude' "$COMPACT_CONTENT"
```

where `$COMPACT_CONTENT` is the full markdown compact state following the template above.

Construct `$COMPACT_CONTENT` using this template:

```markdown
# Session State — YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

## What Was Accomplished
- [Concrete deliverable or milestone, not "worked on X"]
- [Include commit hashes if meaningful]

## Current Task
[What you're working on — specific enough to resume without re-reading the conversation]

## Progress
- [x] Step completed
- [x] Step completed
- [ ] **Current step** — [where you are in this step]
- [ ] Remaining step

## Key Decisions Made
- [Decision]: [rationale] — [alternatives considered if non-obvious]

## Files Created / Modified
- `/absolute/path/to/file.ts` — [what was done to it]

## Active Debugging
[If debugging: the error, what you've tried, what you suspect, reproduction steps]
[If not debugging: omit this section]

## Next Task Context
[What should the next session pick up. Be specific: which work unit, what the first step is, any setup needed.]

## Pending / Open Questions
- [Anything unresolved that the user or next session needs to address]

## Gotchas Discovered
[Anything surprising that future sessions should know — API quirks, timing issues, environment-specific behavior]
```

### Be Specific, Not Generic

"Working on auth" is useless. "Implementing JWT refresh token rotation in `/opt/homelab-mcp-gateway/src/auth/tokens.ts` — access token generation works, refresh token storage in Redis not yet started, blocked on deciding TTL (user leaning toward 7 days)" lets the next window continue immediately.

Emphasize "What Was Accomplished" over "What Was Attempted." The next context window needs to know the current state, not the journey. If something was attempted and failed, note the failure and current state, not the attempt history.

Include absolute file paths. The next session may start in a different working directory.

### Phase 3: Subagent Review

1. **Read the compact state from the DB** before passing it to the subagent:

```bash
source artifacts/db.sh
COMPACT=$(db_read 'meta-context-save' 'compact' 'claude')
```

**Spawn the `compact-reviewer` agent** (`subagent_type: "compact-reviewer"`) to review the compact state. Pass `$COMPACT` as the compact file contents in the prompt. The agent verifies:
   - Resumability — can the next context window pick up without re-reading the conversation?
   - Actionable next steps — is "Next Task Context" specific enough?
   - No references to uncommitted work (Clear mode)
   - No stale file paths or missing context

2. **Correct based on review.** Re-run `db_upsert` with the updated content to address any gaps.

### Phase 4: Execute

- **Compact mode**: Execute `/compact`. The compact state in the DB is what survives.
- **Clear mode**: Execute `/clear`. The compact state in the DB and pushed code are what survive.

## Why Overwrite

`db_upsert` replaces the previous compact record each time because only the latest state matters. The previous record described a context window that no longer exists. Historical session tracking belongs in the plan changelog and cnotes.md.

## Why This Order (Clear mode)

Code gets pushed first because unpushed code in a cleared context is lost code — the next session won't have it in the working tree (if on a different device) and won't know it existed. The compact state is stored second because it needs to reference the commit. The review happens last because it validates everything.

## Examples

```
User: I'm done for today, wrap up
```
Clear mode. GitHub sync (commit and push). Store compact state in DB. Subagent review. Correct. Execute /clear.

```
User: /meta-context-save
```
Compact mode. Assess state, store compact state in DB, subagent review, correct, execute /compact.

```
User: /meta-context-save --clear
```
Clear mode. Full chain: github-sync → store compact state in DB → review → /clear.

```
User: switching to a different project
```
Clear mode. GitHub sync for current project. Store compact state in DB with emphasis on "Next Task Context" so returning is seamless. Review. Clear.

```
[Working tree is already clean, nothing to push — Clear mode]
```
Skip the push (note "working tree clean"). Store compact state in DB. Review. Clear. Do not fail just because there's nothing to commit — the session state still needs preserving.
