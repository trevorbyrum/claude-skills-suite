# Release Prep

Generate a changelog from git history and cnotes.md, bump the version, draft
release notes, and prepare a git tag. The user approves before the tag is
actually created — this skill does not push or publish without confirmation.

## Inputs

- **Current version** — read from `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`,
  `VERSION` file, or whatever the project uses for versioning. If no version
  file exists, ask the user for the current version.
- **Git log since last tag** — `git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0 2>/dev/null || echo "")..HEAD --oneline`
- **cnotes.md** — decision log from the project root. Contains context that
  raw git history misses: why changes were made, trade-offs considered,
  decisions deferred.

## Outputs

- `CHANGELOG.md` updated with new release section
- Version bumped in the project's version file
- Release notes drafted (printed to stdout for review)
- Git tag prepared (not pushed until user approves)

## Exit Condition

Changelog is updated, version is bumped in the source file, and the release
tag is staged. The skill ends by presenting the release notes and asking the
user to confirm before running `git tag` and `git push --tags`.

## Instructions

### 1. Determine Current Version

Search for the version in this priority order:
1. `package.json` — `"version": "x.y.z"`
2. `pyproject.toml` — `version = "x.y.z"`
3. `VERSION` file — raw semver string
4. `Cargo.toml` — `version = "x.y.z"`
5. Most recent git tag matching `v*`

If none found, ask the user. Do not guess.

### 2. Determine Version Bump

Analyze the changes since the last tag to recommend a bump level:

- **Major** (x.0.0) — breaking API changes, removed features, incompatible
  config changes
- **Minor** (0.x.0) — new features, new endpoints, new config options that
  are backward-compatible
- **Patch** (0.0.x) — bug fixes, performance improvements, documentation
  updates, dependency bumps

Present the recommendation to the user with reasoning. Wait for confirmation
or override before proceeding. The user may choose a different bump level.

### 3. Collect Changes

Gather change information from two sources:

**Git log**: Group commits by type using conventional commit prefixes where
present. For commits without prefixes, infer the category from the diff:

- **Added** — new features, new files, new endpoints
- **Changed** — modifications to existing behavior
- **Fixed** — bug fixes
- **Removed** — deleted features or deprecated code
- **Infrastructure** — CI/CD, Docker, deployment, dependency updates
- **Documentation** — docs-only changes

**cnotes.md**: Scan for entries dated after the last release. Extract
decisions, trade-offs, and context that enriches the changelog beyond
one-line commit messages. Reference relevant cnotes entries by their note ID
(CN-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-AUTHOR) in the changelog where they add useful context.

### 4. Update CHANGELOG.md

If `CHANGELOG.md` does not exist, create it with a header. Prepend (not
append) the new release section at the top of the file, below the header.
Format:

```markdown
## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- Description of feature (commit abc1234)

### Changed
- Description of change (commit def5678)

### Fixed
- Description of fix (commit 789abcd)

### Removed
- Description of removal

### Infrastructure
- Description of infra change

### Notes
- Key decision context from cnotes.md (ref: CN-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-AUTHOR)
```

Omit empty sections. Keep descriptions human-readable — rewrite terse commit
messages into complete sentences. One line per change; group related commits
into a single entry where appropriate.

### 5. Bump Version

Update the version string in the project's version file (same file
identified in step 1). For `package.json`, also update `package-lock.json`
if it exists (or note that `npm install` should be run).

### 6. Draft Release Notes

Produce a concise release summary suitable for a GitHub/GitLab release page
or a notification message. Structure:

```
# Release vX.Y.Z

**One-sentence summary of the release.**

## Highlights
- 2-4 bullet points covering the most important changes

## Breaking Changes
- (only if major bump; omit section otherwise)

## Full Changelog
See CHANGELOG.md for the complete list of changes.
```

Print the release notes to stdout. Do not write them to a file unless the
user asks.

### 7. Stage the Tag

Tell the user the exact commands that will be run:

```
git add CHANGELOG.md <version-file>
git commit -m "chore: release vX.Y.Z"
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
```

Ask for explicit confirmation before executing. If the user approves, run
the commands but do NOT push. Tell the user to push when ready:
`git push && git push --tags`.

### Automated Changelog (Codex)

Use Codex to generate a detailed changelog from git history:

1. Dispatch a Codex worker to draft the changelog:
   ```bash
   bash skills/codex/scripts/codex-exec.sh review \
     --cd <project-root> \
     --output /tmp/codex-changelog-draft.md \
     "Analyze the git log since the last release tag. For each commit, categorize as: feat/fix/refactor/docs/chore. Group by category. Write a user-facing changelog in Keep a Changelog format. Include PR numbers if available. Summarize breaking changes separately."
   ```
2. If the command succeeds, read `/tmp/codex-changelog-draft.md` and refine based on cnotes.md entries and human context.
3. If the command fails (exit 1 = Codex unavailable), generate the changelog manually from git log + cnotes.md.

### User-Facing Release Notes (Gemini)

After the changelog is drafted, generate user-friendly release notes:

1. Load `/gemini` for invocation syntax.
2. If available, invoke using the `/gemini` Research / Analysis template with
   a 60s timeout. Do not force `@generalist_agent`. Prompt:
   `"Convert this technical changelog into user-friendly release notes. Focus
   on what users care about: new features, fixed bugs, breaking changes that
   require action. Skip internal refactors. Write in a friendly, professional
   tone. Changelog: [CHANGELOG_CONTENT]"`.
3. Present both the technical changelog and user-facing notes for review.
4. If Gemini is unavailable or fails, retry with Copilot — load `/copilot`
   for invocation syntax. Same prompt, 60s timeout.
5. If both Gemini and Copilot fail, skip user-facing notes — the technical changelog is sufficient.

## Why Two Sources

Git history tells you *what* changed. cnotes.md tells you *why*. A changelog
that only lists commits is a glorified `git log`. A changelog that includes
decision context helps future maintainers (and the user's future self)
understand the intent behind the release.

## Examples

```
User: We just finished the auth overhaul. Prepare a release.
--> Read current version, git log since last tag, and cnotes.md. Recommend a
    minor bump (new feature, backward-compatible). Present changelog draft
    and release notes. Wait for approval before tagging.
```

```
User: Bump the patch version and update the changelog.
--> User has specified patch. Skip the recommendation step. Collect changes,
    update CHANGELOG.md, bump version, draft release notes, stage tag.
```

```
User: /release-prep major
--> User wants a major release. Collect changes, look specifically for
    breaking changes to highlight. Update CHANGELOG.md with a Breaking
    Changes section. Bump major version. Draft release notes with breaking
    changes prominently listed.
```
